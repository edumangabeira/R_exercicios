This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
crude_oil <- read_csv("C:/Users/Eduardo/R_exercicios/wti-crude-oil-prices-10-year-daily-chart.csv")
crude_oil %>%
  data.frame(crude_oil) %>% 
  mutate(date=as.Date(date, format = "%d.%m.%Y"))
typeof(crude_oil$date)
View(crude_oil)

# tudo erradoooooooooooooooooooooo


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

## 7. Exploratory Data Analysis
```{r}
smaller <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat < 3)
  
ggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(x = carat)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1)


ggplot(data = smaller, mapping = aes(x = carat, colour = cut)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.1)
```


```{r}

ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = y), binwidth = 0.5)

ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = y), binwidth = 0.5) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 50))

unusual <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(y < 3 | y > 20) %>% 
  select(price, x, y, z) %>%
  arrange(y)

```
# 7.3.4 Exerc√≠cios

1. Explore the distribution of each of the x, y, and z variables in diamonds. What do you learn? Think about a diamond and how you might decide which dimension is the length, width, and depth.

2. Explore the distribution of price. Do you discover anything unusual or surprising? (Hint: Carefully think about the binwidth and make sure you try a wide range of values.)

3. How many diamonds are 0.99 carat? How many are 1 carat? What do you think is the cause of the difference?

4. Compare and contrast coord_cartesian() vs xlim() or ylim() when zooming in on a histogram. What happens if you leave binwidth unset? What happens if you try and zoom so only half a bar shows?

```{r}
explore_size <- diamonds %>% 
  select(x,y,z) %>% 
  arrange(z)

ggplot(diamonds) + 
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = x), binwidth = 0.5)
```

```{r}
diamonds2 <- diamonds %>% 
  mutate(y = ifelse(y < 3 | y > 20, NA, y))
```
